# 🔐 Password Strength Checker

This is a simple Python-based project that checks the strength of a password and suggests a stronger one if needed. It evaluates password complexity based on length, character types, and randomness.

## 🚀 Features

- Validates password strength: **Weak**, **Medium**, or **Strong**
- Checks for:
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - Use of uppercase and lowercase letters
  - Digits
  - Symbols (e.g., `@`, `#`, `!`)
- Suggests a secure, randomly generated password if input is weak or medium

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Libraries: `re`, `random`, `string`
- (Optional) GUI: `Tkinter`

## 📁 Files Included

- `password_strength_checker.py` – Main Python script
- `Password_Strength_Checker_Complete_Document.pdf` – Project report with explanation, code, and sample output

## 📸 Sample Output
Enter your password: Hello123
Password Strength: Medium
Suggested Strong Password: G#xL92@AvPf1
